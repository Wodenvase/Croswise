CrossWise is an innovative GenAI-powered platform designed to simplify cross-border selling for Indian small and medium businesses (SMBs). It offers tools to streamline compliance with international trade regulations, classify products accurately using HS codes, calculate duties, and ensure smooth product listing for destination countries.

The platform supports both DAP (Delivered at Place) and DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) models, providing flexibility to sellers based on their preferences.

In addition, CrossWise automates export documentation, including IEC, AD Code, GST LUT, and IOR, ensuring compliance and reducing administrative burden. By empowering SMBs with actionable insights and accurate data, CrossWise enables seamless global expansion.
